# Angular CLI Deployment to netlify

Deploy your Angular app to Netlify directly from the Angular CLI! ðŸš€

## Prerequisite

You will need two things in order to get started

- API ID (Site ID) : Every netlify app have a API ID which uniquly identify that app. You can find this inside your project's Setting/General section.
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngx-builders/netlify-builder/master/screenshots/api-id.png)
- [Personal access tokens](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens) : Acess token give you the ability to communicate with netlify over API. This will help you in pushing the code on Netlify.

## Setting up this Builder

```
ng add @netlify-builder/deploy
```

This command will configure everything, you just need to provide API ID and Personal access tokens when it will ask you for that.

## That's it. Now, you are good to go

Now whenever you want to deploy your angular project just run a command `ng run [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]:deploy` and your project got live with new update.


## ðŸ“¦ Options <a name="options"></a>

#### --configuration <a name="configuration"></a>
 * __optional__
 * Alias: `-c`
 * Default: `production` (string)
 * Example:
    * `ng deploy` â€“ Angular project is build in production mode
    * `ng deploy --configuration=test` â€“ Angular project is using the configuration `test` (this configuration must exist in the `angular.json` file)

A named build target, as specified in the `configurations` section of `angular.json`.
Each named target is accompanied by a configuration of option defaults for that target.
Same as `ng build --configuration=XXX`.
This command has no effect if the option `--no-build` option is active.


#### --no-build <a name="no-build"></a>
 * __optional__
 * Default: `false` (string)
 * Example:
    * `ng deploy` â€“ Angular project is build in production mode before the deployment
    * `ng deploy --no-build` â€“ Angular project is NOT build

Skip build process during deployment.
This can be used when you are sure that you haven't changed anything and want to deploy with the latest artifact.
This command causes the `--configuration` setting to have no effect.
